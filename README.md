**Advance-iOS-Project**

Bootcamp project involving MVVM architecture, CoreData, login using Keychain, map functionality, API connections, and testing.

The objective of this practice is to put into practice the contents seen in the module. Create an iOS project using: Storyboard or .xib, Core Data and tests.

For the development of the project, we will use the Dragon Ball rest api. The general idea of the app is that you can: 
	1. Log in. The information returned by this endpoint should be saved in the Keychain.
	2. List the superheroes from Core Data.
	3. Show a map with the superheroes.
	4. Being able to consult the details of a particular hero from the list of superheroes.
  5. On the main screen (list of heroes) there should be a button to log out.
